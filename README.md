==================================================================
Proposal
==================================================================

Description: 
  Text-and-button battle royale game. Intended users are gamers. A player gets a list of other
  players to attack, and their attacks have cooldowns. Available targets are decided randomly,
  with bias for players who previously attacked you, and the list can be influenced by abilities.
  Other than that, all current players of the game are eligible to appear. The goal is to make it
  onto the leaderboard with your score, which factors in survival time and kill count.
